					Born in Florence, this Montréal artist also painted the church’s remarkable frescoes. It is Romanesque in style and laid out in a Greek-cross floorplan It was built 
					by Italian immigrants to the city, specifically those from Molise, to commemorate the apparition of the Madonna in La Difesa, in Casacalenda, Molise
					The altar and balustrade date from 1950 and are made of Carrara marble. Next to the church, Dante Park celebrates the illustrious 14th-century poet and is a 
					favourite meeting place for bocce players and passersby.

					SherStreet, is a major east-west artery and at 31.3 kilometres (19.4 mi) in length, is the second longest street on the Island of Montreal. 
					The street begins in the town of Montreal West and ends on the extreme tip of the island in Pointe-aux-Trembles.
					West of downtown, a mainly English-speaking clientele flocks to Sherbrooke Street for traditional grocery shopping, entertainment and clothing. 
					The Victorian storefronts lend a British ambiance to the neighbourhood’s restaurants, pubs and shops. Once an enclave for Montréal’s wealthiest families, 
					this posh area of the city is now lined with designer boutiques, antique stores, art galleries and many other places to pick up unique and high-end trends. 
					Many of Québec’s leading fashion designers have set up shop on both de la Montagne and Crescent Streets nearby.

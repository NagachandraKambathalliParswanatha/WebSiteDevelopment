				<h3><b>1500's</b></h3>
				<p>
					The story of Montr&eacute;al begins in 1535 with Jacques Cartier, who sailed from France in search of a route to Asia and discovered an island in the St Lawrence River. An Iroquois village called Hochelaga lay at the base of a 233-metre mountain which rose majestically from the middle of the island. From the summit of the mountain, which he named “Mont-Royal,” Cartier could see miles of fertile plain through which the St Lawrence flowed. To his disappointment, however, the river was barred to the southwest by impassable rapids. These rapids were christened “Lachine” (which means China in the English language) because of the belief that beyond them lay the route to China.
				</p>
				<h3><b>1600's</b></h3>
			
				<p>
					In 1609, Samuel de Champlain, the founder of New France, established a trading post just west of today’s Place Royale in Old Montr&eacute;al. Zealous missionaries followed, attempting to convert the natives to Christianity. The first real colony was established in 1642 by Paul de Chomedey, sieur de Maisonneuve. He brought with him Jeanne Mance, who was destined to establish the first hospital, and a small group of settlers. The devoutly Catholic settlement was placed under the protection of the Virgin Mary and named “Ville-Marie de Montr&eacute;al.”
					Montr&eacute;al’s location, at the junction of the St Lawrence and Ottawa rivers, made it a natural hub for communications and transportation. The St Lawrence River provided the link between the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean. The Richelieu River to the south led to Lake Champlain and the headwaters of the Hudson River.
				</p>
			
				<h3><b>1700's</b></h3>
				<p>
					In 1701, after sixty years of bitter fighting, a treaty was signed and peace was made between the French colonists and the Iroquois. The first half of the eighteenth century was dominated, however, by constant war between the French and English. When Quebec City fell to General Wolfe in 1759, the French moved the capital of New France to Montr&eacute;al. On 8 September 1760, Montr&eacute;al surrendered to the British. Its population of 5,000 was almost entirely French. The signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1763 marked the official end of the French regime and the start of British rule. The war had ended, but the clash of Anglo- and Francophone cultures was destined to shape the dynamics of the city for the next two hundred years.
				</p>
				<h3><b>1800's</b></h3>
				<p>	
					The War of 1812 brought another military invasion by the young republic to the south. American troops, emboldened by victories to the west, opened a new front and marched on Montr&eacute;al. The campaign was effectively stopped when Colonel de Salaberry’s forces, comprised of British regulars and French Canadian militia, won a victory at Chateauguay, south of Montr&eacute;al.In 1841 Montr&eacute;al became the capital of the United Canadas (Upper Canada, now Ontario, and Lower Canada, Quebec), a title it retained until 1849. The city became the lifeline of an expanding nation. Its port served as the funnel through which the rest of Canada was connected with the Old World. Great ocean ships laden with manufactured goods of every description sailed 800 kilometres up the St Lawrence to deliver their wares to the port of Montr&eacute;al. Improvements to the port and the development of the railroads fuelled the ever-increasing trade.

				<h3><b>1900's</b></h3>
				<p>
					The election of 1954 of Mayor Jean Drapeau was the start of a vigorous campaign to place Montr&eacute;al in the forefront of sophisticated modern cities.
					Montr&eacute;al embarked upon great projects under the leadership of Mayor Jean Drapeau, several on an international scale. The Métro subway system began in 1966, the International World Exposition took place in 1967.In 1976, Mon&eacute;al was the site of the Summer Olympic Games. Accompanied by considerable construction, the Games were a great success for sportsmanship.and the 1980 Floralies Internationales horticultural fair were hosted by the city. The Metrotro and Expo 67 were undertaken during a period of relative prosperity, After a long period of industrial reorganization marked by high unemployment Montr&eacute;al regained a strong vitality in the mid-1990s, and entered the 21st century with a modernized and buoyant economy.

				<h3><b>Today</b></h3> 
				<p>
					Montr&eacute;al, the second largest French-speaking city in the world, is truly the heart of the province of Quebec. A city of great history by North American standards, its skyscrapers also remind us that it looks ever towards the future. Visitors to Montr&eacute;al are delighted by the opportunity to experience a taste of Europe in North America. Montr&eacute;al’s fans are fiercely devoted, and their interests range from film to food, from hockey to jazz, from technological research to shopping. But more than anything it is a city of warmth, a warmth that permeates even the chill of the Canadian winter.

					<p>
						<b>Old Montréal</b> is a district of contrasts. Alongside the stately grace of the Notre-Dame Basilica and the Bonsecours Market’s glistening 
						dome awaits a wealth of cutting-edge design shops and forward-thinking restaurants. The riverside pathways that teem with joggers and cyclists 
						throughout the day swell with romantic strolling couples after the sun goes down. The area’s beautiful buildings transform nightly into glowing 
						beacons with innovative lighting effects and the modern Grande Roue de Montréal ferris wheel offers new vistas over a grand quartier nearly 400 years in the making.
					</p>

						<h2><b>Montréal Village</b></h2>
					</div>
					
						<img src = "MVillage.jpg" alt = "Image Loading"/>
					



					<p>
						<b>Montréal Village</b> Bustling Sainte-Catherine Street running east to west acts as the gaybourhood’s main drag, stacked with fine eateries, eye-popping boutiques, and a multitude of B and B options housed in uniquely Montréalaise architecture. Welcoming nightclubs that stay packed long into the night personify Montréal’s joie de vivre and the anything goes scene awaits with arms open wide. But the fun runs 24/7, making Le Village one of Montréal’s most vibrant, open, and inclusive quarters both day and night.
					</p>
					<div>
						<h2><b>Parc Jean-Drapeau</b></h2>
						<br/>
					</div>
					
						<img src = "Drapeau.jpg" alt = "Image Loading" />
					

					<p>

						<b>Parc Jean-Drapeau </b> is where fun happens – and not only because it’s home to the Montréal Casino! Come here to dance the day away at music, to luxuriate on the grass with a picnic – or to relive history at Musée Stewart. Best thing is, this four-season paradise is but a 20-minute metro ride from downtown Montréal.
